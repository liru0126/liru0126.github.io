  I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student of machine learning and computer vision under the supervision of 
  [Prof. Guanghui LIU](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=AjfD95EAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and 
  [Prof. Shuaicheng LIU](http://www.liushuaicheng.org/) at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). 
  Meanwhile, I start my internship at Megvii Research since 2018. My research interests include Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), image processing, etc.
